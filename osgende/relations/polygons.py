class RelationPolygons(osgende.OsmosisSubTable):
    """Table of polygons created from relations (aka multipolygons).

       Tries to reconstruct polygons in a fault tolerant way. It should be able to
       handle:

       * simple polygons
       * multipolygons
       * nested relations
       * unclosed ways
       * self-intersecting ways
       * touching holes/polygons
       * ways appearing multiple times (todo)

       'subset' allows to constraint the entries to a subset of relations. Note
       that the table does not know anything about OSM tags and will try to make
       a polygon out of any relation encountered. Creating a table without a
       subquery will work but does not make much sense.

       'child_tags' restricts which subrelations are considered part of the polygon
       description. It contains a list of tags that need to have an equal value
       as the root relations. To include all subrelations, give the empty list.
       If 'child_tags' is set to None, subrelations will be ignored completely.

       As with most tables, this expects the database table to be created 
       externally. The only constraint is that there is an id column and 
       a geometry column that can store
       MULTIPOLYGON types. The name of the column can be given with the 'geom'
       parameter.

       It is possible to transform the final geometries before writing to the database
       by changing the transform string. This can be used, for example, to project
       the geometry or simplify it. TODO describe syntax.
